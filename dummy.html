                  Cindy, a ScholarLink student, had a dream of attending a

                  Jann, a ScholarLink mentee, was once a struggling high school
                  student from an underprivileged community. Through the
                  guidance and support of his mentor, Jann discovered his
                  passion for science and pursued a degree in Biotechnology. He
                  recently graduated with honors and is now working as a
                  research assistant, paving the way for a better future for his
                  family.
